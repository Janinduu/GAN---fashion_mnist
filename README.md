# GAN---fashion_mnist

## Overview
This repository houses the codebase for training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using TensorFlow and Python. The project aims to generate synthetic data that closely resembles the distribution of the training dataset.

## Introduction
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two neural networks, namely the generator and the discriminator, which are trained simultaneously through an adversarial process.

## Components
#### Generator: The generator network takes random noise as input and generates synthetic data samples.
#### Discriminator: The discriminator network is trained to distinguish between real and fake data samples generated by the generator.
#### Training Process: During training, the generator aims to produce data that is indistinguishable from real data, while the discriminator aims to correctly classify real and fake samples.

## Project Structure
#### gan.py: Contains the implementation of the GAN model using TensorFlow.
#### data_utils.py: Includes utilities for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
#### train.py: Script for training the GAN model.
#### utils.py: Helper functions for model evaluation and visualization.
#### requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the TensorFlow Datasets library to access and load the training dataset. The choice of dataset can be customized based on the specific application requirements.

## Training
The GAN model is trained using the TensorFlow framework. The training process involves alternating between updating the parameters of the generator and the discriminator networks using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization.

## Results
After 20 epochs of training on a T4GPU in a Google Colab environment, the generator and discriminator losses converged to 0.0971 and 0.2919, respectively. Despite the promising initial results, there is potential for further improvement through additional epochs and model refinements.

## Future Work
Experiment with different architectural configurations for the generator and discriminator networks.
Explore advanced techniques such as Wasserstein GANs (WGANs) and Progressive GANs for improved stability and convergence.
Evaluate the quality of generated samples using quantitative metrics and human judgment.
Deploy the trained model for generating synthetic data in real-world applications.
